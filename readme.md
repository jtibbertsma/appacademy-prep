# Joseph's App Academy Prep Work

Code is organized into lib and spec folders. The lib folder is further subdivided
into folders for each day. For solo exercises for which we weren't given specs,
I've written my own to practice with rspec. For exercises where we were given
specs, I've converted them to use ```expect``` syntax instead of ```should```.
